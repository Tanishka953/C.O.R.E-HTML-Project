<h1>What's so special about us?</h1>
<p>Genziberg has many special things. First, it has been made from the ground up by Gen Z people only and kids born in this futuristic metropolis are known as the “Gen G” children (as they are born in Genziberg, which is a very proud to be of thing, they are known as Gen G children). Second, AI is considered a part of their life as AI is something that is embedded in almost everything that they use in their daily lives. Third, Robots are embedded with AI which makes Genziberg ‘stand out of the crowd’ and makes it very special. Fourthly, Genziberg has also begun to do experiments on the original Gen Z people to find out the differences between normal people born in 2069 and the original Gen Z people and as it is one of the first nations to begin experimenting on this, we are really different from the normal world’s science.Fifthly, this nation has the most diverse flora and fauna you might have ever seen. From fairy bloomers to Geronimosaurus, we have plants and animals that you have never even heard of!There are many more special things about Genziberg like our smart homes, the methods we use to save the environment and so much, much more.</p>
