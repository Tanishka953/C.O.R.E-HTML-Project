<h1>What's so smart about us?</h1>
<p><b>Genziberg has technology no one on 2100 Earth has. While Normal 2100 Earth has only Robot cars, teachers, employees, surgeons, doctors etc, Genziberg has a much better and improved tech. We have AI embedded in almost all parts of our life, like AI is a part of our life without which, ourlife would be incomplete. Wehave AI driven cars, AI chatbots, AI generated exams, AI as teachers, AI creating books for children to study from and much, much more. Robots are also a big part of our lives. Robots are embedded with AI for agriculture, education, medical purposes, Transportation etc.They help Genziberg ‘stand out of the crowd’ and that is one of the many reasons we are special.</b></p>
<h2>About our Smart Homes</h2>
<p><b>Genziberg might have the most advanced and futuristic smart homes. Every part of your home is embedded into your house’s walls. Your alarm, your workout trainer, AI operated security system, Robot cooks, Robot cleaners and even your own personal home AI!</b></p>
<h2>Some Features of our Smart Homes</h2>
<p><b>When your day starts, your pre-set alarm rings in such a way that your laziness to go back to bed goes away! You can set your alarm the day before at night, and can also set a desired ringtone with it! You can also have a daily workout reminder set for you and also have your own workout AI trainer. You can set different goals for different workouts as our trainer tracks your progress and also times you! It shows your daily improvement and also shows which exercises you did, how many reps, how many sets, how much weight you lifted, how much time you took to complete that specific exercise, etc.Your house’s kitchen also has some of its own features! It has robot cooks which you can modify with your preferences (like veg. Or non.veg, eggs or no eggs etc). You also have access to an AI generated cookbook which you can also modify by talking to the AI who made it and telling it your preferences, then it can modify your cookbook for you.</b></p>
<h2>About our AI Powered Security System</h2>
<p><b>Our AI security systems are very advanced, safe and are shielded from all types of hacks! When you enter your home, our AI uses a fingerprint scanner to verify your fingerprint to verify if it is you or some other stranger trying to enter your house. You can also put the fingerprints of all your fingers and both hands! After this setting, you can use any finger to open your door with no problem! After our fingerprint scan, the AI analyzes your face, eyes and walking pattern. It has a motion sensor which gets activated as soon as you step inside your property. As soon as you step into your property, it starts to scan your face, eyes, and movement pattern. Each AI is fed with all the information about you(the owner of the house) before it is fully activated. We also have invisible motion sensors set up round your entire house which are controlled by the AI. Whenever someone is entering from the back, front, left right or from any direction, the motion sensors get activated and the AI is alerted about it. As soon as the AI detects a person trying to break in to your house, it activates face recognition which detects who is trying to enter your house. They alert you and if you approve the person from entering your home, no safety measures are activated. If they are not approved, then several security measures are switched on one by one.</b></p>
<h2>Some Other Smart Features of our City</h2>
<p><b>Genziberg also has completely automatic delivery drones, smart street lamps(which switch on and off according to time change), Hoverbikes, Maglev trains, AI driven cars, Self-Driving Taxis, Flying Taxis, Autonomous Aerial Vehicles or AAV’s(unmanned flying vehicles), Hyperloop(maglev train which uses magnetic levitation and electromagnetic propulsion),Smart Roads(digitally enhanced roads), Underwater transportation and so much more.</b></p>
<h2>Some Methods we use to save Energy</h2>
<p><b>Genziberg has many different ways of saving energy. First, we have adapted a way of saving energy by using Automated Controls. These controls connect appliances, lighting, heating, and cooling systems to a central smart hub that can adjust the settings based on real-time data. Second, we use Energy Optimization in which is controlled by an AI which(based on real time) automatically turn off lights, adjust thermostat settings, and power down appliances when roms are unoccupied or not in use.Thirdly, we integrate with solar panels or other renewable energy sources to maximize energy efficiency and reduce reliance on grid power and so much more.</b></p>
<h3>We also use many other methods ot save energy,water and have minimized the use of fossil fuels. We in Genziberg have made such an environment that is suitable for our people to live in and to survive in. </h3>
