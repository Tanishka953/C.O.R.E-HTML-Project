<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Who Built Us and How?</h2>
<p><b>Scientists in 2024 used the method of “Cryonics” to freeze human bodies in order to preserve them for the future. Many Gen Z people were picked for this experiment and were frozen in a lab that was buried deep underground. After decades of these bodies being frozen, this lab was found again and all these chambers in which these bodies were preserved were opened. All the Gen Z people were alive and healthy. The two brave founders of Genziberg are Martha Lewison and Jack Doherty. These both were brave enough to go against the world, and to build Genziberg from the group up. They used the world’s current modern technology and learnt about them and built Gen Z and made it more advanced than any place on the 2100 Earth.</b></p>
